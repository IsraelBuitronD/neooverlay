# The following src_compile function is implemented as default by portage, so
# you only need to call it, if you need a different behaviour.
#src_compile() {
	# Most open-source packages use GNU autoconf for configuration.
	# The default, quickest (and preferred) way of running configure is:
	#econf
	#
	# You could use something similar to the following lines to
	# configure your package before compilation.  The "|| die" portion
	# at the end will stop the build process if the command fails.
	# You should use this at the end of critical commands in the build
	# process.  (Hint: Most commands are critical, that is, the build
	# process should abort if they aren't successful.)
	#./configure \
	#	--host=${CHOST} \
	#	--prefix=/usr \
	#	--infodir=/usr/share/info \
	#	--mandir=/usr/share/man || die "./configure failed"
	# Note the use of --infodir and --mandir, above. This is to make
	# this package FHS 2.2-compliant.  For more information, see
	#   http://www.pathname.com/fhs/

	# emake (previously known as pmake) is a script that calls the
	# standard GNU make with parallel building options for speedier
	# builds (especially on SMP systems).  Try emake first.  It might
	# not work for some packages, because some makefiles have bugs
	# related to parallelism, in these cases, use emake -j1 to limit
	# make to a single process.  The -j1 is a visual clue to others
	# that the makefiles have bugs that have been worked around.

	#emake || die "emake failed"
#}

#src_install() {
	# You must *personally verify* that this trick doesn't install
	# anything outside of DESTDIR; do this by reading and
	# understanding the install part of the Makefiles.
	# This is the preferred way to install.
	#echo DESTDIR => ${D}
	#emake DESTDIR="${D}" install || die "emake install failed"

	# When you hit a failure with emake, do not just use make. It is
	# better to fix the Makefiles to allow proper parallelization.
	# If you fail with that, use "emake -j1", it's still better than make.

	# For Makefiles that don't make proper use of DESTDIR, setting
	# prefix is often an alternative.  However if you do this, then
	# you also need to specify mandir and infodir, since they were
	# passed to ./configure as absolute paths (overriding the prefix
	# setting).
	#emake \
	#	prefix="${D}"/usr \
	#	mandir="${D}"/usr/share/man \
	#	infodir="${D}"/usr/share/info \
	#	libdir="${D}"/usr/$(get_libdir) \
	#	install || die "emake install failed"
	# Again, verify the Makefiles!  We don't want anything falling
	# outside of ${D}.

	# The portage shortcut to the above command is simply:
	#
	#einstall || die "einstall failed"
#}
